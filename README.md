# Plant Finder
## Project 3 for CST 438, spring 2021.

Our project is an Android app that can be used to search for different types/categories of plants. 

Our team is made up of: 
* Matthew Reyes, [Xenvex](https://github.com/Xenvex)
* Christopher Cisneros, [ChrisCisneros](https://github.com/ChrisCisneros)
* Annthony Perez, [pere9797](https://github.com/pere9797)

## Minimum Viable Product

The minimum viable product for our project means that a user will be able to search for plants by name, care level, amount of water needed, etc., or an empty search that returns a list of all plants. They will also be able to create an account, save plants to a list, and edit their profile.
